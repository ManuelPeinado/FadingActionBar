FadingActionBar
==================

FadingActionBar is a library which implements the cool fading action bar effect that can be seen in the new Play Music app.

This library uses the techniques outlined by Cyril Mottier in [a popular blog post][1].

The three most commonly used action bar implementations are supported: stock (API 11+), ActionBarCompat and ActionBarSherlock.

Try out the sample application:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar.demo">
  <img alt="Android app on Google Play"
       src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a>

Or browse the [source code of the sample application][3] for a complete example of use.

Including in your project
-------------------------

The library is pushed to Maven Central as a AAR, so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.

```groovy  
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar:3.1.2'
}
```
    
If your project doesn't use the stock action bar, but one of the compatibility implementations, you would use the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Use the following if your project uses ActionBarCompat
    compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar-abc:3.1.2'
    // Or the following if your project uses ActionBarSherlock
    compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar-abs:3.1.2'
}
```


Usage
-----

Using the library is really simple, just look at the source code of the provided samples:

* [If your content should be in a `ScrollView`][4].
* [If your content should be in a `ListView`][5].
* [If your content is a `WebView`][6].

You can even use the library [from a fragment][7], which is useful when implementing a dual phone/tablet layout.

See the demos included in the sample application for a complete overview of the features supported by the library.

Known Issues
------------

There is an important issue with the library and ListViews. More specifically, things don't work quite right when the activity is re-created due to a configuration change. So, unless you handle configuration changes yourself (or your activity is portrait/landscape only), I strongly suggest you stick to having your content in a ScrollView until a solution to this issue is found.
